# üìÖ **CALENDAR INTEGRATION FIXED - MEETINGS NOW VISIBLE!**

## ‚ùå **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:**

**User Issue**: "The meeting was created successfully but where do I find it to click on its details. It's not in the calendar as we had planned before."

**Root Cause**: The calendar events API (`/api/calendar/events`) was only looking at the `calendar_events` table, but scheduled meetings are stored in the `meetings` table. The two systems weren't connected.

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**

### **1. Updated Calendar Events API**
Modified the `/api/calendar/events` endpoint to include both:
- **Calendar Events**: From `calendar_events` table (training, loan reminders, etc.)
- **Meeting Events**: From `meetings` table (scheduled meetings)

### **2. Extended Date Range**
- **Before**: Only showed events from 2024-10-01 to 2024-12-31
- **After**: Now shows events from 2024-10-01 to 2025-12-31 (includes 2025 meetings)

### **3. Meeting Data Integration**
The API now queries both tables and combines the results:

```sql
-- Get calendar events
SELECT ce.*, sg.name as group_name
FROM calendar_events ce
LEFT JOIN savings_groups sg ON ce.group_id = sg.id
WHERE ce.event_date BETWEEN %s AND %s

-- Get meetings as calendar events
SELECT 
    m.id,
    m.meeting_date as event_date,
    m.meeting_time as event_time,
    COALESCE(sc.title, CONCAT('Meeting - ', sg.name)) as title,
    COALESCE(sc.description, m.agenda) as description,
    m.location,
    'MEETING' as event_type,
    m.status,
    m.group_id,
    sg.name as group_name,
    m.created_date
FROM meetings m
LEFT JOIN savings_groups sg ON m.group_id = sg.id
LEFT JOIN scheduler_calendar sc ON sc.meeting_id = m.id
WHERE m.meeting_date BETWEEN %s AND %s
```
