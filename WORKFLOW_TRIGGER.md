# GitHub Actions Workflow Trigger

This file is created to trigger a new GitHub Actions workflow run to verify that all the fixes we applied are working correctly.

## Expected Results

When this commit is pushed, the GitHub Actions workflow should:

✅ **Backend Tests**: Pass with pytest dependencies now available
✅ **Frontend Tests**: Pass with Jest ES6 configuration fixed  
✅ **Database Setup**: Work with improved test base class
✅ **Overall Status**: Show SUCCESS instead of FAILURE

## Verification Timestamp

Created: 2025-09-16 12:15 UTC

## Previous Issues Fixed

1. Missing pytest and pytest-cov dependencies
2. Frontend Jest ES6 module import errors
3. Database constraint conflicts in test teardown
4. Test configuration issues
5. Workflow resilience improvements

This commit should demonstrate that all GitHub Actions failures have been resolved.
