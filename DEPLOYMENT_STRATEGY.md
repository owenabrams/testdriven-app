# Deployment Strategy - Robust Production Management

## 🎯 Overview

This document outlines our **dual-deployment strategy** that ensures reliable production updates even when CI/CD fails. We have two complementary approaches:

1. **Primary**: Automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions
2. **Fallback**: Manual deployment scripts for immediate fixes

## 🚀 Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Automated CI/CD (Primary)
**Trigger**: `git push origin main`
**Status**: ⚠️ Currently experiencing issues
**Use Case**: Regular development workflow

```bash
# Standard development workflow
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your changes"
git push origin main  # Triggers automatic deployment
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Fully automated
- ✅ Includes testing and validation
- ✅ Consistent deployment process
- ✅ Audit trail via GitHub

**Current Issues:**
- ❌ Frontend path references incorrect
- ❌ Build context issues
- ❌ Workflow failures blocking deployments

### Method 2: Manual Deployment (Fallback)
**Trigger**: `./scripts/deploy-manual.sh`
**Status**: ✅ Working and tested
**Use Case**: CI/CD failures, urgent fixes, debugging

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x scripts/deploy-manual.sh

# Deploy specific service
./scripts/deploy-manual.sh frontend
./scripts/deploy-manual.sh backend

# Deploy everything
./scripts/deploy-manual.sh all

# Verify deployment
./scripts/deploy-manual.sh --verify frontend
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Immediate deployment capability
- ✅ Independent of GitHub Actions
- ✅ Full control over process
- ✅ Built-in health checks
- ✅ Rollback capabilities

## 🔄 Recommended Workflow

### For Regular Development:
1. **Try CI/CD first**: `git push origin main`
2. **Monitor GitHub Actions**: Check if deployment succeeds
3. **If CI/CD fails**: Use manual deployment as immediate fallback
4. **Fix CI/CD issues**: Address root cause when time permits

### For Urgent Production Fixes:
1. **Use manual deployment immediately**: Don't wait for CI/CD fixes
2. **Deploy specific service**: Target only what needs updating
3. **Verify deployment**: Use built-in health checks
4. **Update CI/CD later**: Fix automation when pressure is off

## 🛠️ Manual Deployment Features

### Built-in Safety Checks:
- ✅ Prerequisites validation (AWS CLI, Docker, credentials)
- ✅ ECR authentication
- ✅ Image building and tagging with timestamps
- ✅ Task definition updates
- ✅ Deployment monitoring
- ✅ Health verification
- ✅ Rollback capabilities

### Service Management:
```bash
# Deploy frontend only (React app)
./scripts/deploy-manual.sh frontend

# Deploy backend only (Flask API)
./scripts/deploy-manual.sh backend

# Deploy both services
./scripts/deploy-manual.sh all

# Check service health
./scripts/deploy-manual.sh --verify all
```

### Image Tagging Strategy:
- **Manual deployments**: `manual-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
- **CI/CD deployments**: `ci-{commit-hash}`
- **Latest tag**: Always points to most recent successful deployment

## 🔧 Current Production Status - FULLY OPERATIONAL ✅

### ✅ Working Services:
- **Frontend**: http://testdriven-production-alb-1003393901.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
- **Backend API**: Available through ALB routing (/ping, /users, /auth)
- **Database**: Aurora PostgreSQL cluster with 9 seeded users
- **Infrastructure**: ECS Fargate + Application Load Balancer
- **Load Balancer**: Fully configured with intelligent routing

### ✅ All Issues Resolved:
- **Frontend Service**: ✅ Fixed nginx config, deployed successfully
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: ✅ Path references corrected
- **Load Balancer**: ✅ Configured and routing traffic properly
- **Architecture**: ✅ AMD64 compatibility ensured
- **Target Groups**: ✅ Both services healthy and registered

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### If Frontend is Down:
```bash
# Quick fix - deploy with manual script
./scripts/deploy-manual.sh frontend

# Verify it's working
curl -I http://testdriven-production-alb-1003393901.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

### If Backend is Down:
```bash
# Deploy backend
./scripts/deploy-manual.sh backend

# Verify API
curl http://testdriven-production-alb-1003393901.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/ping
```

### If Both Services are Down:
```bash
# Deploy everything
./scripts/deploy-manual.sh all

# Monitor deployment
./scripts/deploy-manual.sh --verify all

# Verify complete application
curl http://testdriven-production-alb-1003393901.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
curl http://testdriven-production-alb-1003393901.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/users
```

## 📋 Next Steps Priority

### Immediate (This Session):
1. ✅ **Manual deployment working** - COMPLETED
2. 🔄 **Deploy frontend with fixed nginx** - IN PROGRESS
3. ⏳ **Verify production access**
4. ⏳ **Set up Application Load Balancer**

### Short Term (Next Few Days):
1. **Fix CI/CD pipeline issues**
2. **Complete ALB configuration**
3. **Add SSL/HTTPS support**
4. **Set up custom domain**

### Long Term (Next Week):
1. **Monitoring and alerting**
2. **Automated rollback procedures**
3. **Blue-green deployment strategy**
4. **Performance optimization**

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Deployment Reliability:
- **Target**: 99% successful deployments
- **Current**: Manual deployment tested and working
- **Fallback**: Always available via manual scripts

### Recovery Time:
- **Target**: < 5 minutes for urgent fixes
- **Current**: Manual deployment takes ~3-5 minutes
- **Improvement**: Automated rollback in development

### Developer Experience:
- **Primary**: Simple `git push` workflow
- **Fallback**: One-command manual deployment
- **Documentation**: Clear procedures for both methods

## 🔗 Quick Reference

**Manual Deployment**: `./scripts/deploy-manual.sh [frontend|backend|all]`
**Health Check**: `./scripts/deploy-manual.sh --verify [service]`
**Current Backend**: http://34.235.113.253:5000
**GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/owenabrams/testdriven-app/actions

**Remember**: Manual deployment is not just a fallback—it's a powerful tool for immediate production control when you need it most.
