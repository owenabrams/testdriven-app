`# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Savings-Group Microservice enables microfinance lenders to issue loans to savings groups (not just individuals) to boost group liquidity and allow members to take more business loans. This follows the VisionFund-style "savings group loans" model where loans go to groups to increase liquidity in the group savings box. The system tracks group lifecycle state, enforces governance rules, and provides transparency and analytics for implementers.

## Enhanced Features (Version 2.0)

The system has been enhanced with comprehensive financial management capabilities including:

- **Enhanced Group Management**: Required location fields (District, Parish, Village), constitution tracking, and registration certificate management
- **Multiple Saving Types**: Personal savings, ECD Fund, Social Fund, and Target savings with configurable parameters
- **Mobile Money Integration**: Support for MTN, Airtel, and other providers with transaction ID tracking and verification workflow
- **Meeting Attendance Tracking**: Regular, special, and annual meeting types with participation metrics for loan assessment
- **Fines Management**: Multiple fine types with payment tracking and integration with cashbook system
- **Comprehensive Cashbook**: All financial activities tracked with running balances by category and audit trail
- **Automated Loan Assessment**: Industry-standard scoring algorithm with risk-based loan limits and terms
- **Loan Repayment Management**: Automated schedule generation with overdue tracking and late fee calculation
