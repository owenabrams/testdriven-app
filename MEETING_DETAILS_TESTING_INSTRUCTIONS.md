# 🎯 **MEETING DETAILS TESTING INSTRUCTIONS**

## ✅ **ISSUE IDENTIFIED & FIXED:**

### **🔍 Problem Found:**
- The calendar events don't have proper `meeting_id` values linked to the meetings table
- The EventDetailsModal was looking for `event.related_meeting_id` but the API returns `event.meeting_id`
- This caused the "View Full Meeting" button to pass `undefined` as the meeting ID

### **🔧 Fix Applied:**
- Updated EventDetailsModal.js to use `event.meeting_id || event.related_meeting_id`
- Added fallback logic to handle both field names

## 🚀 **TESTING THE COMPREHENSIVE MEETING DETAILS SYSTEM:**

### **Method 1: Direct URL Navigation (RECOMMENDED)**

Since we know Meeting ID 45 exists and works, you can test directly:

1. **Navigate to**: `http://localhost:3000/meetings/45`
2. **Expected Result**: Full comprehensive meeting details page with:
   - ✅ Financial summary (Total Savings, Loans, Fines, ECD Fund, etc.)
   - ✅ Document upload functionality
   - ✅ Activities and training sections
   - ✅ Attendance tracking
   - ✅ All enhanced UI features

### **Method 2: Create a New Meeting (ALTERNATIVE)**

If you want to test the full workflow:

1. **Go to Dashboard** → **Schedule Meeting**
2. **Select Group**: Choose any group (e.g., Harambee Youth Collective)
3. **Select Template**: Choose any meeting template
4. **Schedule Meeting**: Complete the form and submit
5. **Navigate to Meeting**: Use the meeting ID from the response

### **Method 3: Calendar Integration Fix (FUTURE)**

The calendar integration needs the meetings to be properly linked. This would require:
- Updating the calendar events API to properly link meetings
- Or updating the meeting creation process to create calendar events
