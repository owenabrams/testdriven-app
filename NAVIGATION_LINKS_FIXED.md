# Navigation Links Fixed - Savings Platform Access

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

The "Savings Platform" link was missing from the navigation because:

1. **Wrong Client Directory**: The startup script was running `services/client/` instead of the main `client/` directory
2. **Old Interface**: The `services/client/` contains an older admin interface (what you saw in your screenshot)
3. **Missing Dependencies**: The main client needed MUI date picker components for the calendar

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

### **1. Startup Script Correction**
```bash
# BEFORE (wrong):
cd ../../services/client

# AFTER (correct):
cd ../../client
```

### **2. Added Missing Dependencies**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@mui/x-date-pickers": "^5.0.0",
    // ... other dependencies
  }
}
```

### **3. Verified Navigation Structure**
The correct navigation structure in `client/src/components/Layout/Layout.js`:

```javascript
// Main Application Menu
- Dashboard
- My Profile  
- System Admin (for super admin)
- Analytics
- All Groups
- Campaigns
- Loans

// MICROSERVICES Section
- Savings Platform ← This was missing before!
```

## 🚀 **How to Access Now**

### **1. Start the Corrected Application**
```bash
./start-local.sh
```

### **2. Login and Navigate**
1. Open: http://localhost:3000
2. Login: `superadmin@testdriven.io` / `superpassword123`
3. Look for **left sidebar navigation** (not the old admin interface)
4. Find **"MICROSERVICES"** section
5. Click **"Savings Platform"**

### **3. Access Activity Calendar**
1. After clicking "Savings Platform", you'll be at `/savings-groups`
2. In the Savings Groups navigation, click **"Activity Calendar"**
3. You'll see the comprehensive filtering system

### **4. Direct Links (if needed)**
- Main App: http://localhost:3000
- Savings Platform: http://localhost:3000/savings-groups
- Activity Calendar: Navigate through the interface

## 🎨 **What You Should See Now**

### **Modern Material-UI Interface**
- Clean sidebar navigation on the left
- Material-UI components and styling
- Professional layout with proper spacing

### **Correct Navigation Structure**

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If you still see the old interface:**
1. Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Run `./start-local.sh` again
4. Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### **If "Savings Platform" link is still missing:**
1. Verify you're logged in as super admin
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Try the direct link: http://localhost:3000/savings-groups

### **If you get dependency errors:**
```bash
cd client
npm install
```
