## 🚀 **Getting Started with UI Development**

### **1. Start the Development Environment**
```bash
# Start backend API (required)
cd services/users
python manage.py run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000

# Start UI development server
./start-ui.sh
# Opens http://localhost:3000
```

### **2. Development Workflow**
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd client && npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Run tests (when implemented)
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### **3. API Integration Pattern**
```javascript
// Example: Using the API client
import { savingsGroupsAPI } from '../services/api';
import { useQuery, useMutation } from 'react-query';

// Fetch data
const { data: groups, isLoading } = useQuery(
  'savings-groups',
  () => savingsGroupsAPI.getGroups()
);

// Mutate data
const createGroup = useMutation(
  (data) => savingsGroupsAPI.createGroup(data),
  {
    onSuccess: () => {
      toast.success('Group created!');
      refetch();
    }
  }
);
```

## 📱 **Mobile-First Design Principles**

### **Touch-Friendly Interface**
- **44px minimum touch targets** for buttons and links
- **Swipe gestures** for navigation and actions
- **Pull-to-refresh** for data updates
- **Haptic feedback** for user interactions

### **Progressive Web App (PWA) Ready**
- **Service Worker** configuration for offline support
- **Web App Manifest** for app-like installation
- **Push Notifications** for real-time updates
- **Background Sync** for offline actions

## 🎨 **Design System Guidelines**

### **Color Usage**
```css
Primary Green (#2E7D32):   Savings, financial success, growth
Secondary Orange (#FF9800): Campaigns, targets, warnings
Success Green (#4CAF50):   Completed actions, positive states
Warning Orange (#FF9800):  Attention needed, pending actions
Error Red (#F44336):       Errors, failed actions, alerts
```

### **Typography Hierarchy**
```css
H1 (2.5rem): Page titles, main headings
H2 (2rem):   Section headers, card titles
H3 (1.5rem): Subsection headers, dialog titles
H4 (1.25rem): Component titles, form sections
Body1 (1rem): Primary text content
Body2 (0.875rem): Secondary text, captions
```

### **Spacing System**
```css
Base unit: 8px
Micro: 4px (0.5 units)
Small: 8px (1 unit)
Medium: 16px (2 units)
Large: 24px (3 units)
XLarge: 32px (4 units)
```
