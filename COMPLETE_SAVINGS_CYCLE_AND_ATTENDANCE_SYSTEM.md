> **"A cycle: Members meet weekly or monthly to save money as a group members (there will be different saving types as you have seen we have in the system)"**

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: 
- `savings_cycles` table tracks complete cycle lifecycle
- Multiple saving types supported (`saving_types` table)

- Interest and fine distribution calculations
- Automatic cycle progression system

> **"All the groups must have a 'saving cycle' (which can be of varying periods (months) for each individual group)"**

- Individual group cycle management
- Current cycle tracking with start/end dates

## **📊 CREDIT SCORING & ELIGIBILITY - FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### **✅ Your Requirements Met:**

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: 
- `credit_score` field in savings_groups
- Cycle completion tracking (`total_cycles_completed`)
- Third-year achievement tracking (`is_in_third_year`)

> **"75% of group members plan to take a loan and invest in income generating activities – this will give the group a good credit score"**

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: 
- Loan participation rate tracking
- Credit score calculation based on loan uptake
- Investment activity purpose tracking

> **"Group should have completed financial literacy training – how do we track this"**

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: 
- `financial_literacy_training` table
- Training completion tracking per group
- Certificate issuance and assessment scoring

> **"Group member should have been also attending meetings as required, at least above 50% to be considered for loans"**

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: 
- Automatic attendance percentage calculation
- 50% threshold enforcement for loan eligibility
- `is_eligible_for_loans` field based on attendance

---

## **📅 COMPREHENSIVE ATTENDANCE SYSTEM - FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### **✅ Your Requirements Met:**

> **"How is attendance for activities in a meeting tracked in relation to other interconnected tables?"**

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: 
- **Activity-based attendance detection**: Attendance automatically recorded when members participate in savings, loans, or fine payments
- **Interconnected tracking**: Meeting attendance linked to actual financial activities
- **Participation scoring**: Comprehensive scoring based on activity engagement

> **"Do we bundle everything under the 'meeting' and simply say, one attended the meeting and if there is a record on that specific meeting date for their saving, fines, loans, or loan repaying activity, then that is also an indicator of their participation"**

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: 
- **Smart attendance detection**: System automatically marks attendance when financial activity occurs on meeting dates
- **Activity participation tracking**: Separate flags for savings_contributed, loan_activity, fine_paid
- **Participation scoring**: Calculated based on actual engagement level

> **"Can this attendance also have an option to appear on the map. to show which dates a member did not attend?"**

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: 
- **Geographic attendance mapping**: `/api/attendance/absence-map` endpoint
- **Absence date visualization**: Shows specific dates when members were absent
- **Location tracking**: Geographic coordinates and location data for mapping
- **Visual attendance patterns**: Separate data for attended vs absent meetings

> **"What about if we want to see general attendance for the group members (this time as a group) to compare with other groups?"**

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: 
- **Group attendance comparison**: `/api/attendance/group-comparison` endpoint
- **Performance ranking**: Groups ranked by attendance rates
- **Regional comparison**: Filter by region/district for comparison
- **Performance levels**: EXCELLENT, HIGH, MODERATE, LOW classifications

---

## **🗺️ CALENDAR FILTERING SYSTEM - FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### **✅ Your Requirements Met:**

> **"is the activity calendar filtering system fully functional (by regions,districts, parishes, villages, gender, saving type, roles, amount minimum or maximum, by group, . . .etc.)"**

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: 
- **Geographic filtering**: Region → District → Parish → Village hierarchy
- **Demographic filtering**: Gender, roles, member types
- **Financial filtering**: Amount ranges (min/max), saving types, fund types
- **Group filtering**: Specific group or multi-group analysis
- **Date filtering**: Custom date ranges and periods
- **Activity type filtering**: Savings, loans, meetings, training, fines

---

## **🔗 REAL CALENDAR FROM ACTUAL ACTIVITIES**

### **✅ Key Achievement:**

> **"Remember that the data in the activity calendar above should not be demo data (mock data) but rather real user data linked to user activities within their groups"**

✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: 
- **Real calendar events**: Generated from actual member savings, loan activities, and fine payments
- **Activity-driven calendar**: Calendar automatically updates when members perform financial activities
- **Interconnected data**: Calendar events linked to real group member activities
- **No mock data**: All calendar events represent actual user transactions and participation
