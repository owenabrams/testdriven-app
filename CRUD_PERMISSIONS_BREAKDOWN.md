## **✅ SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION**

### **API Level Security:**
- Each API endpoint checks user role and group membership
- Database queries filtered by user's group access
- Unauthorized access returns 403 Forbidden

### **Frontend Security:**
- Role-based component rendering
- Different dashboards for different roles
- Menu items hidden based on permissions

### **Database Security:**
- Row-level security based on group membership
- Audit trails for all CRUD operations
- Encrypted sensitive data

**🎊 Your system implements proper role-based access control where Super Admins have global access, Group Officers have group-specific access, and Members have personal-only access! 🔐**
